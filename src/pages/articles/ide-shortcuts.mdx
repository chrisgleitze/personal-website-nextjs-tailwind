Here's a list of the most important shortcuts that help you navigate and edit your code base quickly. I use those in Webstorm, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of my choice.

Of all the things that are not specific to programming languages, fast typing speed and shortcuts for quicker navigation and edit of your code base are the top things that make you a more efficient programmer. This brings you a big step closer to black belt programmer.

I see two reasons for using shortcuts to navigate and edit your code base:

1. **You're quicker.** And speed matters to try ideas quickly. Being quicker keeps you happier when you're coding. Nobody likes wasting time. Programmers just as much as the next person.
2. **Your code is less prone to errors.** If you use a shortcut to select all occurrences, you make sure to select all occurrences. If you select each occurrence by hand until you have all, you really need to pay attention not to miss one.
