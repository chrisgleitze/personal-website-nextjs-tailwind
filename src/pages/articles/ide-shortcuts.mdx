Here's a list of the most important shortcuts that help you navigate and edit your code base quickly. I use those in Webstorm, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of my choice.

I see two reasons for using shortcuts to navigate and edit your code base:

1. **You're quicker.** And speed matters for trying ideas quickly. Being quicker keeps you happier when you're coding. Nobody likes wasting time. Programmers just as much as the next person.
2. **Your code is less prone to errors.** If you use a shortcut to select all occurrences, you make sure to select all occurrences. If you select each occurrence by hand until you have all, you really need to pay attention not to miss one.

Another thing that makes you a more efficient programmer is fast typing speed. Besides getting good at the programming languages themselves. By using those you go a big step from white belt to black belt programmer. And to happier programmer. Why? Because quicker coding + less errors = happier programmer

Of course there are many more shortcuts you could use. Some people will argue that there are some missing here. Though I think these are the 20 % that bring you 80 % of the benefit.
