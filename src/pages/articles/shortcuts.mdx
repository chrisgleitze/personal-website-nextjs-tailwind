Here's a list of the most important shortcuts that help you navigate and edit your code base quickly. Of all the things that are not specific to programming languages, typing speed and shortcuts for quicker navigation and edit of your code base are the top things that make you a more efficient programmer.

I see two reasons for using shortcuts to navigate and edit your code base:

1. **You're quicker.** And speed matters to try ideas quickly. Being quicker keeps you happier when you're coding. Nobody likes wasting time. Programmers just as much as the next person.
2. **Your code is less prone to errors.** If you use a shortcut to select all occurrences, you make sure to select all occurrences. If you select each occurrence by hand until you have all, you really need to pay attention not to miss one.

Navigating your code base can be tedious and annoying.

I use these shortcuts in WebStorm, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of my choice.
