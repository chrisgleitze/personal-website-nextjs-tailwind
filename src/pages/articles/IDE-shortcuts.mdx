One thing I could've used when I started to code was a list of only the most important Git commands. I didn't have that. Though once I had some experience using Git I created that list myself and published it in my blog. So, now you can have that.

Navigating your code base can be tedious and annoying.

I use these shortcuts in WebStorm, my IDE or code editor.

What is this list not? A comprehensive list of all or most shortcuts to navigate and edit your codebase.

What is this list? A list of shortcuts that speeds up your work in your IDE.

How can you use it? As inspiration to add these shortcuts to your IDE.
