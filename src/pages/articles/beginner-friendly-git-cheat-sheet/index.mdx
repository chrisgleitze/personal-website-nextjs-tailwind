Here you find a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Cheat Sheet that I put together while working on my first projects as Frontend Developer.

What is beginner friendly about it? It consists of only the most important git commands to get started programming. I added short explanations of what each command does.

By now I know most of these commands by heart. Though this is what I would’ve liked to have when I started out. So maybe you’re just starting out and you can benefit from it.

Download it as [PDF](./Beginner-Git-Cheat-Sheet.pdf) or as [text file](./Beginner-Git-Cheat-Sheet.txt) in case you want to edit it.
