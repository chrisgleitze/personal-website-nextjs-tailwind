Here you find a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Cheat Sheet that I put together while working on my first projects as Frontend Developer. Git is a version control system (VCS) for software projects. Over 90 % of developers use git instead of other VCS.

What is beginner friendly about it? It consists of only the most important git commands that you use regularly. It consists of only the most important git commands. I added short explanations of what each command does.

By now I know most of these commands by heart. Though this is what I would’ve liked to have when I started out. So maybe you’re just starting out and you can benefit from it.

Download it as PDF or as text file, in case you want to edit it.
