[Jerry Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld) is doing comedy since the 1970s. What I like a lot about him is his professionalism. He doesn't drink alcohol, doesn't swear, always wears a suit on stage and writes daily on his comedy. About creating ideas for his comedy, he says:

_It's very important to know what you don't like. A big part of innovation is saying, "You know what I'm really sick of?"_

I heard Seinfeld say that on my favorite podcast, [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/2020/12/08/jerry-seinfeld/). He also explained the sentiment in an interview with the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2017/01/lifes-work-jerry-seinfeld). There he added:

_For me, [what I was really sick of] was talk shows where music plays, somebody walks out to a desk, shakes hands with the host, and sits down. "How are you?" "You look great." I'm also sick of people who are really there to sell their show or product. You can start innovating by answering the question: What am I really sick of?_

Seinfeld's explanation reminded me a lot of when I planned my own podcast, [The Connecting Dots Podcast](https://linktr.ee/ConnectingDotsPod). In the summer of 2019 I didn't yet have the exact concept for my podcast in mind but I already knew what I didn't want it to be.

**What I did _not_ want my podcast to be:**

1.  consisting of short episodes (10-20 minutes) that only scratch the surface of a topic
2.  talking about one topic only, e.g. only startups, only marketing, only digitization
3.  being too much about showing off, selling my guest's product or brand

**So what _should_ my podcast be like?**

1.  long episodes consisting of deep-dive conversations
2.  treating many different topics because I'm a curious person
3.  being authentic and honest

That already gave me a lot to work with and guided me well on my podcast journey. So if you don't know what to do, start writing down what not to do.
