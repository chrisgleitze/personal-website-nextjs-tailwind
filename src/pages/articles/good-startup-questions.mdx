After more than 30 episodes of my interview podcast, [The Connecting Dots Podcast](https://linktr.ee/ConnectingDotsPod), I collected a big amount of startup questions. Let me share what questions worked for my interview podcast:

**The importance of follow-up questions!**

Those questions below just offer a gateway into stories, experiences and points of view that you _have_ to take. This is what makes long-form interview podcasts like mine much more interesting than the superficial podcasts consisting of 15-30 mins/ep. In longer conversations you can get a feel for the interviewee: Is (s)he more risk averse or more risk friendly? What are his/her ambitions? How does their upbringing influence their work (if at all)?

Those follow-ups are not 'what?'-questions but 'how?'-questions: Not _what_ did you do but _how_ did you do that? Another example: When did you start your company? In 2015? Ah ok, now **lead me through** the first 6 months of founding your company. Some more good follow-ups: **What was** your thought process **like** when pivoting to X? **How did you feel** with the pressure of this big investment round on your back?

Another reason why I'm happy to have those standard questions below: I always feel more relaxed having so many questions that I can ask if a conversation stagnates or I don't know what to ask next.

**Questions for startup founders**

**on startups**

- What is the core idea of your startup/business?
- What's the business model?
- What distinguishes your startup/business from other startups/businesses?
- What will give your startup a competitive advantage in the next 2-3 years?
- What is the 3-5 year vision for your startup/of your work?
- What is the "end goal" of your startup?
- Bootstrapped or getting investors on board?

**on co-founders**

- What (skills, knowledge, personality) were you looking for in a co-founder?
- How are the tasks shared between you and your co-founder?

**lessons learned**

- Biggest learning(s) as a founder?
- Biggest lesson in pitching your startup? And what did you do wrong at first? What did you do well from the beginning?
- Most rewarding and most frustrating startup experiences?
- How did a failure or apparent failure lead to success (or something positive)? So, for example: Some people get fired from a job only to find out that they then have great other opportunities like working for themselves.
