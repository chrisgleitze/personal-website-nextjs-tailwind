This list is the result of six years of loving to listen to interview podcasts.

I've been writing this list religiously since 2016. I just scribble down the topic of that bit of the podcast conversation that I liked while listening to it. So, I – and now you, too – can come back to to that part and listen to it again. Why? Because it's inspirational. I mainly listen to podcasts for inspiration, new perspectives and the like. Not for mere information. I prefer consuming information in text form.

There are so many episodes of the [Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/) on the list because it’s always been my favorite podcast. It’s actually the podcast that made me fall in love with podcasts in general back in spring 2016.

## Why I like the Tim Ferriss Show so much?

1.  He offers tools and thought exercises to identify and overcome limited thinking.
2.  He and his guests talk in detail about routines and tactics that everybody can implement right away.
