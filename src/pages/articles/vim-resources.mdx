Vim is a text editor that makes navigating and editing code easy and fast. Over the years it garnered a cult-like following and a very lively ecosystem online. A downside of such a big ecosystem is that there is not one central place to find all the information. What I offer here is many beginner and advanced Vim motions in one place.

In the first part you find many straight forward Vim tips. The last two parts are very helpful tips I learned from ThePrimeagen, a Vim enthusiast who is very popular on YouTube and Twitch.

What can you do with the resources below? Copy it all and use it as cheat sheet, pick from it what you find interesting or do whatever else you want to do with it.

This is list is not fully comprehensive! This is just a lot of the stuff that I like and use often.

This is a comment by ThePrimeagen on Reddit on how to get quicker at navigating with Vim:

```text title="ThePrimeagen on Faster Navigation"
Faster Navigation
from the Primeagen on Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/m330z4/getting_faster/

Insert Modes:

Learn to take advantage of o and O, A. They are awesome.

yanks/highlights/dels:

ciw, yiw, viw are amazing, but if you need to do the _whole_ word, try yiW. I do this a bunch. Imagine the following: Namespace::Class foo and you want to copy Namespace::Class, you could put your cursor at N and yf<space> but yiW also works (you don't have to be at the beginning of the word) (for this example I don't provide much benefit, but its incredible once you get it)

Vertical Navigation

get use to page ups and downs. I have been resistant for 9.5 years on those, and only since I adopted tmux (traveling the output) have I finally leaned in. ctrl+d/u is exceptionally awesome and they dont alter jump list.

Jump List

Take advantage of the jump list. Example:

I need to add an include/import. I use ggOimport foo from "bar";<esc><ctrl+o>. This will go to the top, insert mode top line, adds import, leaves insert, and travels back from whence I came (like the ring).

File Navigation

Fuzzy finders are great when you don't have an instant jump to the file. Use them. Don't use nerdtree / netrw / dirvish / etc etc etc etc etc.

QuickFix / LocalFix

Learn quick fix menus and their navigation. I have quit using <Ctrl-j/k> and <leader>j/k for window nav and instead use C-j/k for quickfix navigation and <leader>j/k for localfix navigation. cdo or bust

Sorry for the brain dump, but its been an incredible journey for me and I absolutely love to share some wisdom.

Ultimately, how I envision vim should work and why it works so well is that you "think" of what you want and there are keystrokes to accomplish it. If you find yourself just aimlessly scrolling, stop, why should be a big question on your mind.

Lastly, I hate to fearlessly shill my own product, but if you are interested in an alternative to file navigation and use neovim, I would be glad to share my experimental plugin.

Life is to short to proof read

The "Fighting one-eyed Kirby" is what ThePrimeagen calls a Vim regex capture group to replace text in the buffer.

```text title="ThePrimeagen's "Fighting one-eyed Kirby""
Primeagen's "fighting one-eyed Kirby"
video: https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen/clip/GentleBumblingLadiesAMPEnergyCherry-MlGwozjH5QU2gV8t

Further explanation: https://waylonwalker.com/thoughts-200/

The following explanation is from this comment on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/12v4q06/can_anyone_explain_how_to_do_the_fighting_one/

foo
bar
baz

:%s/\(.*\)/bar\1/g

barfoo
barbar
barbaz

Whats going on here....

%s replace all lines

/ start pattern

\(.*\) the \ are escapes, so the regex is (.*) this basically captures everything on the line and places it into capture group 1

/ substitute section

bar\1 bar is just text, the \ is an escape and the 1 is the previous capture group.

/g finish the set
```
